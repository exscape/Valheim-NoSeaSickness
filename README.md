**No Sea Sickness** for Valheim

**NOTE: Most users should get this from Nexus mods:**
[Nexus mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/635)

This page only has the source code required to build or modify the mod.

Requires [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) and supports [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases).  
You also need to have the publicized assembly\_valheim.dll (and possibly edit the path to it). [ValheimPlus's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md) talks about how to set this up for Valheim modding.
